rubberband
==========

A bash script for getting useful ElasticSearch information all at once into a single file.

Just run this script on any ElasticSearch node!

Usage: ./rubberband.sh \<filename\>

Where filename is the output of the script.  

**I will be updating this to make the entire output one big JSON object for easier parsing**
